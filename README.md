## 📚 **Documentation**
If you encounter any problems, or if you want to use the program in a particular way, I advise you to read the [documentation](https://pyproxytools.github.io/pyproxy-docs/).

## 🔧 **To do**

- Support content analysis
- Caching of latest and most searched pages

## 🏎️ **Benchmark**

If you're interested in benchmarking the performance of the proxy or comparing request times with and without a proxy, please refer to the [Benchmark repository](https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy-benchmark) for detailed instructions on how to run the benchmarking tests and generate reports.

## 📦 Deployment with Ansible

If you want to deploy **pyproxy** automatically to remote servers (via source or Docker), an official [Ansible role](https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy-ansible) is available:

* 🔧 Install from source or run as a Docker container
* 📁 Supports customization of ports, versions, and paths
* 🚀 Easily integrable into your infrastructure or CI/CD pipelines

👉 Check out the [pyproxy-ansible](https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy-ansible) repository for more details and usage instructions.

## 🧩 **Python SDK for Administration and Monitoring**

A dedicated Python SDK is available to interact programmatically with the **pyproxy** administration and monitoring interface: [**pyproxy-sdk-py**](https://github.com/pyproxytools/pyproxy-sdk-py).
This SDK provides a simple and consistent API to manage your proxy configuration remotely — allowing you to add or delete domains, manage URLs, create and remove clients, and perform other administrative tasks. It is designed to integrate easily into automation scripts, dashboards, or backend systems that need to control and monitor pyproxy instances.
